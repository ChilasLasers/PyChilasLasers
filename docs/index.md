# Welcome to Chilas documentation

This is the documentation for the python library used to control our tunable lasers. The [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md) follows a tutorial with the most common use cases for the lasers and usual operation. And the [Package Reference](package/index.md) section is a rendering of the code documentation in a nice readable format for quick reference. Please use it to your convenience to get a more in depth look at how to properly use this library.
